that ship has sailed
that’s the last straw
the ball is in your court
the best of both worlds
the best things in life are free
the bigger they are, the harder they fall
the devil is in the details
the early bird catches the worm
the elephant in the room

the icing on the cake
the last straw
the long and short of it
the pen is mightier than the sword
the pot calling the kettle black
the proof is in the pudding

you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink
you can’t have it both ways
you can’t have your cake and eat it too
you can’t judge a book by its cover
you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
you made your bed, now lie in it
you reap what you sow
you’re pulling my leg
your guess is as good as mine
your heart skips a beat
you said:
you scratch my back, i’ll scratch yours
zip it!
zip your lip
