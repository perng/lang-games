in a pickle
in terms of
in the zone
joke around
lend a hand
lend an ear
mess around
narrow down
nose around
on the ball
on thin ice
put down to
put forward
put on airs
put through
put up with
red herring
run against
second wind
see through
settle down
shake a leg
shop around
sleep on it
smell a rat
split apart
split hairs
spring back
square away
strike back
think ahead
tie in with
turn around
wait around
all the rage
an open book
bear down on
bet the farm
breathe easy
bring around
burn bridges
by a whisker
by and large
chew the cud
chew the fat
clear as day
cold comfort
come forward
come through
come up with
couch potato
cutting edge
dime a dozen
do away with
down and out
draw a blank
fall back on
fall through
far cry from
fit the bill
follow along
game changer
get a leg up
get the boot
get together
go for broke
go overboard
golden goose
have a blast
have it made
have no idea
high and dry
hit the road
hit the roof
in hot water
in the clear
jump the gun
leave behind
look down on
look forward
loose cannon
make the cut
meet halfway
no love lost
not a chance
off the cuff
off the hook
on the fence
over the top

cold shoulder
cut and dried
dead giveaway
down to earth

fill the bill
full of beans
get a move on
get cold feet
give and take
good riddance
hand to mouth
hang in there
hang out with
heart of gold
hit the books
in a nutshell
in cold blood
in deep water
kiss of death
knock on wood
let off steam
love is blind
miss the boat
miss the mark
my cup of tea
neck and neck
on cloud nine
out of pocket
over the moon
pay the piper
penny pincher
piece of cake
play hardball
pull the plug
raise the bar
read the room
right as rain
rock the boat
rule of thumb
see the light
spill the tea
take off with
take the cake
think through
time is money
up in the air
walk the talk
wander around
warts and all
when pigs fly
a dime a dozen
as cold as ice
as easy as pie
back to basics
bat an eyelash
be on the ball
be on thin ice
beat the clock
black and blue
blind as a bat
blow off steam
blow your mind
boil the ocean
break the bank
break the mold
broad daylight
brownie points
call the shots
cheap as chips
cook the books
crack the whip
crash and burn
cry me a river
don’t cry wolf
drag your feet
eat humble pie
face the facts
face the music
fan the flames
fast and loose
feel the pinch
find your feet
follow through
for the record
funny business
good samaritan
hand over fist
keep your cool
know the ropes
like clockwork
live and learn
make ends meet
make one’s day
mum’s the word
off the charts
pay it forward
piece together
play it by ear
pull one’s leg
push your luck
rule the roost
run in circles
scrape through
see eye to eye
steal the show
stuck in a rut
stumble across
take the reins
the last straw
time will tell
to cut corners
under the wire
a perfect storm
a piece of cake
a stone's throw
apple of my eye
as clear as mud
as good as gold
as plain as day
at a crossroads
at death’s door
back in the day
backseat driver
ballpark figure
baptism by fire
be an open book
bite the bullet
black and white
call it a night
change of heart
chase your tail
clear as a bell
climb the walls
come up against
cook up a storm
cool your heels
cut the mustard
dream come true
dressed to kill
eat like a bird
eat one’s words
fair and square
fall from grace
fine-tooth comb
fit as a fiddle
flip the script
fly on the wall
full of hot air
get out of hand
give me a break
grasp at straws
green with envy
half-baked idea
happy as a clam
head over heels
hit rock bottom
hit the jackpot
in the long run
keep an eye out
lead by example
learn the ropes
look forward to
lose your touch
monkey business
move the needle
on a shoestring
pat on the back
picture perfect
picture-perfect
pull a fast one
put a lid on it
sharp as a tack
shot in the arm
smell the roses
spill the beans
stay the course
take a breather
take the plunge
under the radar
under the table
under your nose
use your noodle
watch the clock
watch your back
work like a dog
a bridge too far
against all odds
against the odds
all bets are off
an arm and a leg
apple of discord
around the clock
as bold as brass
as busy as a bee
as right as rain
bite your tongue
blue in the face
bob’s your uncle
burn the bridges
burning question
bury the hatchet
change your tune
clutch at straws
come full circle
crack someone up
cut to the chase
devil’s advocate
do a double take
don’t have a cow
down to the wire
drop a bombshell
eat like a horse
fit like a glove
flash in the pan
food for thought
get off the hook
go down swinging
go out on a limb
go with the flow
golden handshake
grin and bear it
hang by a thread
have a field day
have a soft spot
hold your horses
hold your tongue
hot and bothered
in one’s element
in the same boat
lay down the law
life’s a journey
life’s too short
live on the edge
long story short
music to my ears
no pain, no gain
on the same page
out of my league
pop the question
quick as a flash
run out of steam
save your breath
shot in the dark
sleep like a log
stay in the loop
take a back seat
talk of the town
turn a blind eye
under one’s nose
whole nine yards
wild goose chase
a bird’s-eye view
against the clock
against the grain
ahead of the game
all hands on deck
an eye for an eye
around the corner
as blind as a bat
as high as a kite
as smooth as silk
as the crow flies
at your wit’s end
babe in the woods
beat a dead horse
between the lines
burn your bridges
caught in the act
caught red-handed
corner the market
dead in the water
dig your heels in
dog-eat-dog world
down in the dumps
