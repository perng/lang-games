keep your head above water
let the cat out of the bag
life is not a bed of roses
many hands make light work
pull a rabbit out of a hat
put the pedal to the metal
rome wasn’t built in a day
take the bull by the horns
there’s no place like home
too many irons in the fire
a snowball’s chance in hell
a stitch in time saves nine
another day, another dollar
blood is thicker than water
butterflies in your stomach
don’t cry over spilled milk
familiarity breeds contempt
from the bottom of my heart
it never rains but it pours
keep one’s head above water
like a bull in a china shop
like a kid in a candy store
money doesn’t grow on trees
put your foot in your mouth
the devil is in the details
the grass is always greener
the proof is in the pudding
up a creek without a paddle
what goes up must come down
without a shadow of a doubt
you can’t have it both ways
a house divided cannot stand
a taste of your own medicine
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
burn the candle at both ends
get into the swing of things
get something off your chest
go back to the drawing board
have a chip on your shoulder
just what the doctor ordered
lay one’s cards on the table
like water off a duck’s back
not playing with a full deck
penny-wise and pound-foolish
take it with a grain of salt
take it with a pinch of salt
variety is the spice of life
wake up and smell the coffee
walk in someone else’s shoes
all that glitters is not gold
carry the weight of the world
fly by the seat of your pants
give the benefit of the doubt
have one’s head in the clouds
have your cake and eat it too
hear it through the grapevine
kill two birds with one stone
laugh all the way to the bank
laughter is the best medicine
make hay while the sun shines
put one’s foot in one’s mouth
put the cart before the horse
slow and steady wins the race
two heads are better than one
what goes around comes around
your guess is as good as mine
fly by the seat of one’s pants
get the short end of the stick
give someone the cold shoulder
he who laughs last laughs best
light at the end of the tunnel
like shooting fish in a barrel
little strokes fell great oaks
walk a mile in someone’s shoes
wear your heart on your sleeve
a penny saved is a penny earned
a rolling stone gathers no moss
actions speak louder than words
between a rock and a hard place
bite off more than you can chew
burning the candle at both ends
can’t judge a book by its cover
can’t make heads or tails of it
don’t judge a book by its cover
every cloud has a silver lining
give credit where credit is due
half a loaf is better than none
if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
never judge a book by its cover
put all your eggs in one basket
straight from the horse’s mouth
the early bird catches the worm
a leopard can’t change its spots
all dressed up and nowhere to go
cleanliness is next to godliness
don’t let the cat out of the bag
don’t throw good money after bad
keep your nose to the grindstone
man does not live by bread alone
the best things in life are free
the pot calling the kettle black
you made your bed, now lie in it
a picture paints a thousand words
birds of a feather flock together
if you can’t beat them, join them
keep one’s nose to the grindstone
make a mountain out of a molehill
not the sharpest tool in the shed
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
time flies when you’re having fun
when in rome, do as the romans do
where there’s smoke, there’s fire
a leopard doesn’t change its spots
always a bridesmaid, never a bride
butter wouldn’t melt in your mouth
can’t see the forest for the trees
don’t bite the hand that feeds you
give someone a run for their money
good things come to those who wait
have eyes in the back of your head
jack of all trades, master of none
know it like the back of your hand
never bite the hand that feeds you
the pen is mightier than the sword
to err is human, to forgive divine
a picture is worth a thousand words
absence makes the heart grow fonder
butter wouldn’t melt in one’s mouth
don’t put the cart before the horse
get up on the wrong side of the bed
you can’t judge a book by its cover
a fool and his money are soon parted
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
necessity is the mother of invention
never look a gift horse in the mouth
cross that bridge when you come to it
don’t put all your eggs in one basket
give someone the benefit of the doubt
stuck between a rock and a hard place
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
caught between a rock and a hard place
between the devil and the deep blue sea
born with a silver spoon in one’s mouth
hear it straight from the horse’s mouth
out of the frying pan and into the fire
you can’t have your cake and eat it too
you scratch my back, i’ll scratch yours
hope for the best, prepare for the worst
one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
the bigger they are, the harder they fall
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
give someone a taste of their own medicine
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
don’t count your chickens before they hatch
don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater
the grass is always greener on the other side
you can’t make an omelet without breaking eggs
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me
people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones
you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink
