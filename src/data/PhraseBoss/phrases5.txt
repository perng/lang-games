a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
absence makes the heart grow fonder
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
actions speak louder than words
a fool and his money are soon parted
a house divided against itself cannot stand
a house divided cannot stand
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
a leopard can’t change its spots
a leopard doesn’t change its spots
a little knowledge is a dangerous thing
all dressed up and nowhere to go
all good things come to an end
all good things come to those who wait
all good things must come to an end
all that glitters is not gold
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
always a bridesmaid, never a bride
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
an empty vessel makes the most noise
an idle mind is the devil’s workshop
another day, another dollar
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
a penny for your thoughts
a penny saved is a penny earned
a picture is worth a thousand words
april showers bring may flowers
a rolling stone gathers no moss
a snowball’s chance in hell
a stitch in time saves nine
as you sow, so shall you reap
a taste of your own medicine
a watched pot never boils
barking dogs seldom bite
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
beauty is only skin deep
beggars can’t be choosers
better a bird in the hand than two in the bush
better late than never
better safe than sorry
better the devil you know than the devil you don’t
between a rock and a hard place
between the devil and the deep blue sea
birds of a feather flock together
bite off more than you can chew
blood is thicker than water
born with a silver spoon in one’s mouth
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
burning the candle at both ends
burn the candle at both ends
butterflies in your stomach
butter wouldn’t melt in one’s mouth
butter wouldn’t melt in your mouth
can’t judge a book by its cover
can’t make heads or tails of it
can’t see the forest for the trees
carry the weight of the world
caught between a rock and a hard place
cleanliness is next to godliness
clothes don’t make the man
cowards die many times before their deaths
cross the bridge when you come to it
curiosity killed the cat
don’t bark if you can’t bite
don’t bite off more than you can chew
don’t bite the hand that feeds you
don’t burn the candle at both ends
don’t burn your bridges behind you
don’t count your chickens before they hatch
don’t cross the bridge until you come to it
don’t cry over spilled milk
don’t judge a book by its cover
don’t judge a man until you’ve walked a mile in his shoes
don’t kill the goose that lays the golden egg
don’t let the cat out of the bag
don’t look a gift horse in the mouth
don’t make a mountain out of a molehill
don’t mix business with pleasure
don’t put all your eggs in one basket
don’t put the cart before the horse
don’t throw good money after bad
don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater
early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise
easy come, easy go
every cloud has a silver lining
every dog has its day
every rose has its thorn
failing to plan is planning to fail
familiarity breeds contempt
fly by the seat of your pants
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me
fortune favors the brave
fortune favors the prepared mind
from the bottom of my heart
get into the swing of things
get something off your chest
get the short end of the stick
get up on the wrong side of the bed
give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day; teach him to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime
give credit where credit is due
give someone a run for their money
give someone a taste of their own medicine
give someone the benefit of the doubt
give someone the cold shoulder
give the benefit of the doubt
go back to the drawing board
god helps those who help themselves
good fences make good neighbors
good things come to those who wait
great minds think alike
half a loaf is better than none
haste makes waste
have a chip on your shoulder
have eyes in the back of your head
have one’s head in the clouds
have your cake and eat it too
hear it straight from the horse’s mouth
hear it through the grapevine
he who hesitates is lost
he who laughs last, laughs best
honesty is the best policy
hope for the best, prepare for the worst
if at first, you don’t succeed, try, try again
if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it
if the shoe fits, wear it
if you can’t beat them, join them
if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
ignorance is bliss
it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
it never rains but it pours
it’s always darkest before the dawn
it takes one to know one
it takes two to tango
jack of all trades, master of none
just what the doctor ordered
keep one’s head above water
keep one’s nose to the grindstone
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
keep your head above water
keep your nose to the grindstone
kill two birds with one stone
know it like the back of your hand
knowledge is power
laugh all the way to the bank
laughter is the best medicine
lay one’s cards on the table
let bygones be bygones
let sleeping dogs lie
let the cat out of the bag
let the chips fall where they may
life is not a bed of roses
life is what you make it
light at the end of the tunnel
lightning never strikes the same place twice
like a bull in a china shop
like a kid in a candy store
like shooting fish in a barrel
like water off a duck’s back
little strokes fell great oaks
live and let live
look before you leap
love is blind
make a mountain out of a molehill
make hay while the sun shines
man does not live by bread alone
many hands make light work
money doesn’t grow on trees
necessity is the mother of invention
never bite off more than you can chew
never bite the hand that feeds you
never judge a book by its cover
never judge a man until you’ve walked a mile in his shoes
never look a gift horse in the mouth
never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
no man is an island
no news is good news
no pain, no gain
nothing ventured, nothing gained
not playing with a full deck
not the sharpest tool in the shed
old habits die hard
once bitten, twice shy
one good turn deserves another
one man’s trash is another man’s treasure
opportunity never knocks twice
out of sight, out of mind
out of the frying pan and into the fire
patience is a virtue
penny-wise and pound-foolish
people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones
people who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones
practice makes perfect
practice what you preach
prevention is better than cure
pull a rabbit out of a hat
put all your eggs in one basket
put one’s foot in one’s mouth
put the cart before the horse
put the pedal to the metal
put your foot in your mouth
rome wasn’t built in a day
slow and steady wins the race
sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
still waters run deep
straight from the horse’s mouth
strike while the iron is hot
stuck between a rock and a hard place
take it with a grain of salt
take it with a pinch of salt
take the bull by the horns
the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree
the best things in life are free
the bigger they are, the harder they fall
the darkest hour is just before the dawn
the devil is in the details
the early bird catches the worm
the ends justify the means
the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
the more things change, the more they stay the same
the pen is mightier than the sword
the pot calling the kettle black
the proof is in the pudding
there are plenty of fish in the sea
there’s no place like home
there’s no use crying over spilled milk
the road to hell is paved with good intentions
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
time and tide wait for no man
time flies when you’re having fun
time heals all wounds
time waits for no one
to err is human, to forgive divine
too many cooks spoil the broth
too many irons in the fire
too much of a good thing can be bad
two heads are better than one
two wrongs don’t make a right
up a creek without a paddle
variety is the spice of life
wake up and smell the coffee
walk a mile in someone’s shoes
walk in someone else’s shoes
waste not, want not
wear your heart on your sleeve
what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger
what goes around comes around
what goes up must come down
when in rome, do as the romans do
when the going gets tough, the tough get going
where there’s a will, there’s a way
where there’s smoke, there’s fire
without a shadow of a doubt
you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink
you can’t have it both ways
you can’t have your cake and eat it too
you can’t judge a book by its cover
you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
you can’t please everyone
you can’t take it with you
you can’t teach an old dog new tricks
you made your bed, now lie in it
you reap what you sow
you’re only as strong as your weakest link
your guess is as good as mine
you scratch my back, i’ll scratch yours
youth is wasted on the young
zest is the spice of life
