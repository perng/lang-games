cheap as chips
cook the books

fast and loose

find your feet

funny business
good samaritan

like clockwork
live and learn
make ends meet
make oneâ€™s day
mumâ€™s the word
off the charts
pay it forward
piece together
play it by ear
pull oneâ€™s leg
push your luck
rule the roost
run in circles
scrape through
see eye to eye
steal the show
stuck in a rut
stumble across
take the reins
the last straw
time will tell
to cut corners
under the wire
a perfect storm
a piece of cake
a stone's throw
apple of my eye
as clear as mud
as good as gold
as plain as day
at a crossroads
at deathâ€™s door
back in the day
backseat driver
ballpark figure
baptism by fire
be an open book
bite the bullet
black and white
call it a night
change of heart
chase your tail
clear as a bell
climb the walls

cook up a storm
cool your heels
cut the mustard
dream come true
dressed to kill
eat like a bird
eat oneâ€™s words
fair and square
fall from grace
fine-tooth comb
fit as a fiddle
flip the script
fly on the wall
full of hot air
get out of hand
give me a break
grasp at straws
green with envy
half-baked idea
happy as a clam
head over heels
hit rock bottom
hit the jackpot
in the long run
keep an eye out
lead by example
learn the ropes
look forward to
lose your touch
monkey business
move the needle
on a shoestring
pat on the back
picture perfect
picture-perfect
pull a fast one
put a lid on it
sharp as a tack
shot in the arm
smell the roses
spill the beans
stay the course
take a breather
take the plunge
under the radar
under the table
under your nose
use your noodle
watch the clock
watch your back
work like a dog
a bridge too far
against all odds
against the odds
all bets are off
an arm and a leg
apple of discord
around the clock
as bold as brass
as busy as a bee
as right as rain
bite your tongue
blue in the face
bobâ€™s your uncle
burn the bridges
burning question
bury the hatchet
change your tune
clutch at straws
come full circle
crack someone up
cut to the chase
devilâ€™s advocate
do a double take
donâ€™t have a cow
down to the wire
drop a bombshell
eat like a horse
fit like a glove
flash in the pan
food for thought
get off the hook
go down swinging
go out on a limb
go with the flow
golden handshake
grin and bear it
hang by a thread
have a field day
have a soft spot
hold your horses
hold your tongue
hot and bothered
in oneâ€™s element
in the same boat
lay down the law
lifeâ€™s a journey
lifeâ€™s too short
live on the edge
long story short
music to my ears
no pain, no gain
on the same page
out of my league
pop the question
quick as a flash
run out of steam
save your breath
shot in the dark
sleep like a log
stay in the loop
take a back seat
talk of the town
turn a blind eye
under oneâ€™s nose
whole nine yards
wild goose chase
a birdâ€™s-eye view
against the clock
against the grain
ahead of the game
all hands on deck
an eye for an eye
around the corner
as blind as a bat
as high as a kite
as smooth as silk
as the crow flies
at your witâ€™s end
babe in the woods
beat a dead horse
between the lines
burn your bridges
caught in the act
caught red-handed
corner the market
dead in the water
dig your heels in
dog-eat-dog world
down in the dumps
down in the mouth
face like thunder
fall on deaf ears
fish out of water
follow your heart
get a kick out of
get a second wind
give a wide berth
go down in flames
go the extra mile
haste makes waste
hold oneâ€™s horses
hot off the press
in one fell swoop
in over your head
keep your chin up
life of the party
live and let live
lose your marbles
low-hanging fruit
my hands are tied
nip it in the bud
not my cup of tea
out of left field
over my dead body
playing with fire
quick on the draw
right off the bat
right up my alley
saved by the bell
sleep like a baby
stand your ground
storm in a teacup
take a chill pill
take a rain check
to each their own
two peas in a pod
under the weather
win-win situation
work like a charm
a pain in the neck
a walk in the park
ace up your sleeve
along for the ride
apple of oneâ€™s eye
as sharp as a tack
as strong as an ox
at oneâ€™s witâ€™s end
back in the saddle
back to square one
bang for your buck
bigger fish to fry
blow your own horn
bring to the table
burst at the seams
clean as a whistle
close but no cigar
come rain or shine
come to grips with
cool as a cucumber
cross your fingers
dead as a doornail
dig your own grave
divide and conquer
dog days of summer
double-edged sword
down for the count
drop in the bucket
drown your sorrows
eat your heart out
fill in the blanks
first things first
fly off the handle
get the hang of it
go over oneâ€™s head
golden opportunity
gone with the wind
green-eyed monster
have a gut feeling
have it in the bag
head in the clouds
ignorance is bliss
in black and white
in over oneâ€™s head
itâ€™s a small world
jack of all trades
jump through hoops
keep oneâ€™s chin up
knowledge is power
last but not least
learn the hard way
lose oneâ€™s marbles
move the goalposts
on the back burner
once in a lifetime
paint the town red
pull someoneâ€™s leg
reinvent the wheel
shoot from the hip
speak of the devil
stand oneâ€™s ground
start from scratch
stick to your guns
throw in the towel
tip of the iceberg
to go the distance
top of the morning
what are the odds?
with flying colors
a drop in the ocean
a fish out of water
a slap on the wrist
a storm in a teacup
all in a dayâ€™s work
as a matter of fact
as fresh as a daisy
as old as the hills
at a loss for words
beat about the bush
behind closed doors
bend over backwards
best of both worlds
brush under the rug
by a hairâ€™s breadth
by hook or by crook
card up your sleeve
close, but no cigar
donâ€™t rock the boat
drown oneâ€™s sorrows
fair-weather friend
fall by the wayside
few and far between
fix someoneâ€™s wagon
fly in the ointment
for crying out loud
for what itâ€™s worth
from rags to riches
get the green light
hang in the balance
have a bone to pick
have the last laugh
heart in your mouth
home away from home
in the nick of time
jump to conclusions
keep it under wraps
level playing field
life is but a dream
lost in the shuffle
never a dull moment
off the beaten path
on pins and needles
once in a blue moon
open a can of worms
piece of the puzzle
push comes to shove
shoot for the stars
steal oneâ€™s thunder
stick to oneâ€™s guns
take it on the chin
the skyâ€™s the limit
too good to be true
waste not, want not
whatâ€™s done is done
add fuel to the fire
add insult to injury
all bark and no bite
all in the same boat
at the crack of dawn
at the drop of a hat
at the eleventh hour
bark worse than bite
beat around the bush
bottom of the barrel
bring home the bacon
call a spade a spade
cast the first stone
cat got your tongue?
clean bill of health
come out in the wash
count your blessings
dressed to the nines
drive a hard bargain
elephant in the room
feather in oneâ€™s cap
fight fire with fire
fight tooth and nail
get the ball rolling
go against the grain
go around in circles
hard pill to swallow
have an axe to grind
have your hands full
in the driverâ€™s seat
keep your nose clean
look before you leap
patience is a virtue
pay through the nose
rain on oneâ€™s parade
red carpet treatment
save for a rainy day
sink your teeth into
sitting on the fence
spread like wildfire
step up to the plate
that ship has sailed
the whole nine yards
turn over a new leaf
a piece of the action
as bright as a button
as cool as a cucumber
as light as a feather
as quick as lightning
at the end of the day
avoid like the plague
back against the wall
backhanded compliment
ball is in your court
behind the eight ball
blow your own trumpet
burn the midnight oil
calm before the storm
canâ€™t cut the mustard
chip on your shoulder
cost an arm and a leg
cry over spilled milk
easier said than done
every dog has his day
every dog has its day
feel it in your bones
get bent out of shape
get it off your chest
get your act together
give someone the boot
have oneâ€™s hands full
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
jump out of your skin
keep your eyes peeled
let sleeping dogs lie
like father, like son
make oneâ€™s blood boil
method to the madness
move heaven and earth
play devilâ€™s advocate
play your cards right
raining cats and dogs
rock and a hard place
roll with the punches
rub salt in the wound
shoulder to the wheel
thatâ€™s the last straw
the icing on the cake
think outside the box
time heals all wounds
to make matters worse
you reap what you sow
youâ€™re pulling my leg
a blessing in disguise
a diamond in the rough
air your dirty laundry
all roads lead to rome
bark up the wrong tree
better late than never
better safe than sorry
bitter pill to swallow
canâ€™t hold a candle to
chip off the old block
come out of your shell
donâ€™t hold your breath
get a foot in the door
get oneâ€™s act together
green around the gills
have a change of heart
hit the ground running
it goes without saying
keep a stiff upper lip
let bygones be bygones
like two peas in a pod
make no bones about it
mind your own business
off the top of my head
on a shoestring budget
on the same wavelength
once bitten, twice shy
practice makes perfect
pull out all the stops
pull yourself together
read between the lines
scratch someoneâ€™s back
short end of the stick
skeleton in the closet
step on someoneâ€™s toes
sticking your neck out
the tip of the iceberg
water under the bridge
a chip on your shoulder
adding fuel to the fire
beating around the bush
blind leading the blind
blood, sweat, and tears
come hell or high water
cut from the same cloth
devil is in the details
donâ€™t burn your bridges
get down to brass tacks
get on someoneâ€™s nerves
get to the bottom of it
get your ducks in a row
go the whole nine yards
great minds think alike
have bigger fish to fry
itâ€™s not rocket science
leave no stone unturned
level the playing field
living on borrowed time
make a long story short
more bang for your buck
more than meets the eye
penny for your thoughts
set the record straight
steal someoneâ€™s thunder
take a shot in the dark
the best of both worlds
to add insult to injury
when it rains, it pours
your heart skips a beat
a chip off the old block
a skeleton in the closet
at the end of oneâ€™s rope
at the top of your lungs
avoid it like the plague
beauty is only skin deep
big fish in a small pond
build castles in the air
come out of the woodwork
curiosity killed the cat
dance on someoneâ€™s grave
every rose has its thorn
first come, first served
get oneâ€™s ducks in a row
have a lot on your plate
he who hesitates is lost
hit the nail on the head
it takes one to know one
life is what you make it
like a fish out of water
not out of the woods yet
not the end of the world
off the top of your head
put two and two together
the elephant in the room
the long and short of it
the world is your oyster
when push comes to shove
worth its weight in gold
a penny for your thoughts
a watched pot never boils
allâ€™s well that ends well
at the top of oneâ€™s lungs
back to the drawing board
bark worse than your bite
barking up the wrong tree
beat someone to the punch
beggars canâ€™t be choosers
black sheep of the family
by the seat of your pants
by the skin of your teeth
carrot and stick approach
caught between two stools
donâ€™t count your chickens
donâ€™t jump to conclusions
drive someone up the wall
feel like a million bucks
feeling under the weather
four corners of the earth
get off on the right foot
get off on the wrong foot
give a piece of your mind
if the shoe fits, wear it
in the heat of the moment
keep an ear to the ground
keep your eye on the ball
keep your fingers crossed
off the top of oneâ€™s head
out of sight, out of mind
the ball is in your court
throw caution to the wind
a matter of life and death
allâ€™s fair in love and war
another string to your bow
burn a hole in your pocket
by the seat of oneâ€™s pants
get in on the ground floor
give a piece of oneâ€™s mind
give a run for oneâ€™s money
have an ace up your sleeve
hear through the grapevine
home is where the heart is
honesty is the best policy
keep your head above water
let the cat out of the bag
life is not a bed of roses
many hands make light work
pull a rabbit out of a hat
put the pedal to the metal
rome wasnâ€™t built in a day
take the bull by the horns
thereâ€™s no place like home
too many irons in the fire
a snowballâ€™s chance in hell
a stitch in time saves nine
another day, another dollar
blood is thicker than water
butterflies in your stomach
donâ€™t cry over spilled milk
familiarity breeds contempt
from the bottom of my heart
it never rains but it pours
keep oneâ€™s head above water
like a bull in a china shop
like a kid in a candy store
money doesnâ€™t grow on trees
put your foot in your mouth
the devil is in the details
the grass is always greener
the proof is in the pudding
up a creek without a paddle
what goes up must come down
without a shadow of a doubt
you canâ€™t have it both ways
a house divided cannot stand
a taste of your own medicine
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed
burn the candle at both ends
get into the swing of things
get something off your chest
go back to the drawing board
have a chip on your shoulder
just what the doctor ordered
lay oneâ€™s cards on the table
like water off a duckâ€™s back
not playing with a full deck
penny-wise and pound-foolish
take it with a grain of salt
take it with a pinch of salt
variety is the spice of life
wake up and smell the coffee
walk in someone elseâ€™s shoes
all that glitters is not gold
carry the weight of the world
fly by the seat of your pants
give the benefit of the doubt
have oneâ€™s head in the clouds
have your cake and eat it too
hear it through the grapevine
kill two birds with one stone
laugh all the way to the bank
laughter is the best medicine
make hay while the sun shines
put oneâ€™s foot in oneâ€™s mouth
put the cart before the horse
slow and steady wins the race
two heads are better than one
what goes around comes around
your guess is as good as mine
fly by the seat of oneâ€™s pants
get the short end of the stick
give someone the cold shoulder
he who laughs last laughs best
light at the end of the tunnel
like shooting fish in a barrel
little strokes fell great oaks
walk a mile in someoneâ€™s shoes
wear your heart on your sleeve
a penny saved is a penny earned
a rolling stone gathers no moss
actions speak louder than words
between a rock and a hard place
bite off more than you can chew
burning the candle at both ends
canâ€™t judge a book by its cover
canâ€™t make heads or tails of it
donâ€™t judge a book by its cover
every cloud has a silver lining
give credit where credit is due
half a loaf is better than none
if it ainâ€™t broke, donâ€™t fix it
never judge a book by its cover
put all your eggs in one basket
straight from the horseâ€™s mouth
the early bird catches the worm
a leopard canâ€™t change its spots
all dressed up and nowhere to go
cleanliness is next to godliness
donâ€™t let the cat out of the bag
donâ€™t throw good money after bad
keep your nose to the grindstone
man does not live by bread alone
the best things in life are free
the pot calling the kettle black
you made your bed, now lie in it
a picture paints a thousand words
birds of a feather flock together
if you canâ€™t beat them, join them
keep oneâ€™s nose to the grindstone
make a mountain out of a molehill
not the sharpest tool in the shed
the squeaky wheel gets the grease
time flies when youâ€™re having fun
when in rome, do as the romans do
where thereâ€™s smoke, thereâ€™s fire
a leopard doesnâ€™t change its spots
always a bridesmaid, never a bride
butter wouldnâ€™t melt in your mouth
canâ€™t see the forest for the trees
donâ€™t bite the hand that feeds you
give someone a run for their money
good things come to those who wait
have eyes in the back of your head
jack of all trades, master of none
know it like the back of your hand
never bite the hand that feeds you
the pen is mightier than the sword
to err is human, to forgive divine
a picture is worth a thousand words
absence makes the heart grow fonder
butter wouldnâ€™t melt in oneâ€™s mouth
donâ€™t put the cart before the horse
get up on the wrong side of the bed
you canâ€™t judge a book by its cover
a fool and his money are soon parted
beauty is in the eye of the beholder
necessity is the mother of invention
never look a gift horse in the mouth
cross that bridge when you come to it
donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket
give someone the benefit of the doubt
stuck between a rock and a hard place
you canâ€™t teach an old dog new tricks
caught between a rock and a hard place
between the devil and the deep blue sea
born with a silver spoon in oneâ€™s mouth
hear it straight from the horseâ€™s mouth
out of the frying pan and into the fire
you canâ€™t have your cake and eat it too
you scratch my back, iâ€™ll scratch yours
hope for the best, prepare for the worst
one manâ€™s trash is another manâ€™s treasure
the bigger they are, the harder they fall
all work and no play makes jack a dull boy
give someone a taste of their own medicine
a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
donâ€™t count your chickens before they hatch
donâ€™t throw the baby out with the bathwater
the grass is always greener on the other side
you canâ€™t make an omelet without breaking eggs
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
never put off until tomorrow what you can do today
if you canâ€™t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen
you canâ€™t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs
fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me
people who live in glass houses shouldnâ€™t throw stones
you can lead a horse to water, but you canâ€™t make it drink
