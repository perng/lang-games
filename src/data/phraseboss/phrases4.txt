down in the mouth
face like thunder
fall on deaf ears
fish out of water
follow your heart
get a kick out of
get a second wind
give a wide berth
go down in flames
go the extra mile
haste makes waste
hold one’s horses
hot off the press
in one fell swoop
in over your head
keep your chin up
life of the party
live and let live
lose your marbles
low-hanging fruit
my hands are tied
nip it in the bud
not my cup of tea
out of left field
over my dead body
playing with fire
quick on the draw
right off the bat
right up my alley
saved by the bell
sleep like a baby
stand your ground
storm in a teacup
take a chill pill
take a rain check
to each their own
two peas in a pod
under the weather
win-win situation
work like a charm
a pain in the neck
a walk in the park
ace up your sleeve
along for the ride
apple of one’s eye
as sharp as a tack
as strong as an ox
at one’s wit’s end
back in the saddle
back to square one
bang for your buck
bigger fish to fry
blow your own horn
bring to the table
burst at the seams
clean as a whistle
close but no cigar
come rain or shine
come to grips with
cool as a cucumber
cross your fingers
dead as a doornail
dig your own grave
divide and conquer
dog days of summer
double-edged sword
down for the count
drop in the bucket
drown your sorrows
eat your heart out
fill in the blanks
first things first
fly off the handle
get the hang of it
go over one’s head
golden opportunity
gone with the wind
green-eyed monster
have a gut feeling
have it in the bag
head in the clouds
ignorance is bliss
in black and white
in over one’s head
it’s a small world
jack of all trades
jump through hoops
keep one’s chin up
knowledge is power
last but not least
learn the hard way
lose one’s marbles
move the goalposts
on the back burner
once in a lifetime
paint the town red
pull someone’s leg
reinvent the wheel
shoot from the hip
speak of the devil
stand one’s ground
start from scratch
stick to your guns
throw in the towel
tip of the iceberg
to go the distance
top of the morning
what are the odds?
with flying colors
a drop in the ocean
a fish out of water
a slap on the wrist
a storm in a teacup
all in a day’s work
as a matter of fact
as fresh as a daisy
as old as the hills
at a loss for words
beat about the bush
behind closed doors
bend over backwards
best of both worlds
brush under the rug
by a hair’s breadth
by hook or by crook
card up your sleeve
close, but no cigar
don’t rock the boat
drown one’s sorrows
fair-weather friend
fall by the wayside
few and far between
fix someone’s wagon
fly in the ointment
for crying out loud
for what it’s worth
from rags to riches
get the green light
hang in the balance
have a bone to pick
have the last laugh
heart in your mouth
home away from home
in the nick of time
jump to conclusions
keep it under wraps
level playing field
life is but a dream
lost in the shuffle
never a dull moment
off the beaten path
on pins and needles
once in a blue moon
open a can of worms
piece of the puzzle
push comes to shove
shoot for the stars
steal one’s thunder
stick to one’s guns
take it on the chin
the sky’s the limit
too good to be true
waste not, want not
what’s done is done
add fuel to the fire
add insult to injury
all bark and no bite
all in the same boat
at the crack of dawn
at the drop of a hat
at the eleventh hour
bark worse than bite
beat around the bush
bottom of the barrel
bring home the bacon
call a spade a spade
cast the first stone
cat got your tongue?
clean bill of health
come out in the wash
count your blessings
dressed to the nines
drive a hard bargain
elephant in the room
feather in one’s cap
fight fire with fire
fight tooth and nail
get the ball rolling
go against the grain
go around in circles
hard pill to swallow
have an axe to grind
have your hands full
in the driver’s seat
keep your nose clean
look before you leap
patience is a virtue
pay through the nose
rain on one’s parade
red carpet treatment
save for a rainy day
sink your teeth into
sitting on the fence
spread like wildfire
step up to the plate
that ship has sailed
the whole nine yards
turn over a new leaf
a piece of the action
as bright as a button
as cool as a cucumber
as light as a feather
as quick as lightning
at the end of the day
avoid like the plague
back against the wall
backhanded compliment
ball is in your court
behind the eight ball
blow your own trumpet
burn the midnight oil
calm before the storm
can’t cut the mustard
chip on your shoulder
cost an arm and a leg
cry over spilled milk
easier said than done
every dog has his day
every dog has its day
feel it in your bones
get bent out of shape
get it off your chest
get your act together
give someone the boot
have one’s hands full
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
jump out of your skin
keep your eyes peeled
let sleeping dogs lie
like father, like son
make one’s blood boil
method to the madness
move heaven and earth
play devil’s advocate
play your cards right
raining cats and dogs
rock and a hard place
roll with the punches
rub salt in the wound
shoulder to the wheel
that’s the last straw
the icing on the cake
think outside the box
time heals all wounds
to make matters worse
you reap what you sow
you’re pulling my leg
a blessing in disguise
a diamond in the rough
air your dirty laundry
all roads lead to rome
bark up the wrong tree
better late than never
better safe than sorry
bitter pill to swallow
can’t hold a candle to
chip off the old block
come out of your shell
don’t hold your breath
get a foot in the door
get one’s act together
green around the gills
have a change of heart
hit the ground running
it goes without saying
keep a stiff upper lip
let bygones be bygones
like two peas in a pod
make no bones about it
mind your own business
off the top of my head
on a shoestring budget
on the same wavelength
once bitten, twice shy
practice makes perfect
pull out all the stops
pull yourself together
read between the lines
scratch someone’s back
short end of the stick
skeleton in the closet
step on someone’s toes
sticking your neck out
the tip of the iceberg
water under the bridge
a chip on your shoulder
adding fuel to the fire
beating around the bush
blind leading the blind
blood, sweat, and tears
come hell or high water
cut from the same cloth
devil is in the details
don’t burn your bridges
get down to brass tacks
get on someone’s nerves
get to the bottom of it
get your ducks in a row
go the whole nine yards
great minds think alike
have bigger fish to fry
it’s not rocket science
leave no stone unturned
level the playing field
living on borrowed time
make a long story short
more bang for your buck
more than meets the eye
penny for your thoughts
set the record straight
steal someone’s thunder
take a shot in the dark
the best of both worlds
to add insult to injury
when it rains, it pours
your heart skips a beat
a chip off the old block
a skeleton in the closet
at the end of one’s rope
at the top of your lungs
avoid it like the plague
beauty is only skin deep
big fish in a small pond
build castles in the air
come out of the woodwork
curiosity killed the cat
dance on someone’s grave
every rose has its thorn
first come, first served
get one’s ducks in a row
have a lot on your plate
he who hesitates is lost
hit the nail on the head
it takes one to know one
life is what you make it
like a fish out of water
not out of the woods yet
not the end of the world
off the top of your head
put two and two together
the elephant in the room
the long and short of it
the world is your oyster
when push comes to shove
worth its weight in gold
a penny for your thoughts
a watched pot never boils
all’s well that ends well
at the top of one’s lungs
back to the drawing board
bark worse than your bite
barking up the wrong tree
beat someone to the punch
beggars can’t be choosers
black sheep of the family
by the seat of your pants
by the skin of your teeth
carrot and stick approach
caught between two stools
don’t count your chickens
don’t jump to conclusions
drive someone up the wall
feel like a million bucks
feeling under the weather
four corners of the earth
get off on the right foot
get off on the wrong foot
give a piece of your mind
if the shoe fits, wear it
in the heat of the moment
keep an ear to the ground
keep your eye on the ball
keep your fingers crossed
off the top of one’s head
out of sight, out of mind
the ball is in your court
throw caution to the wind
a matter of life and death
all’s fair in love and war
another string to your bow
burn a hole in your pocket
by the seat of one’s pants
get in on the ground floor
give a piece of one’s mind
give a run for one’s money
have an ace up your sleeve
hear through the grapevine
home is where the heart is
honesty is the best policy
