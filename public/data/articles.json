As he nibbled on a page, he felt like the stories were talking to him, like they wanted him to join their adventures. But Pip's nights were not always safe. There were big, scary cats, loud vacuums, and stomping human feet that could crush him. Still, he couldn’t stop exploring. Every night, while the city was quiet, Pip lived his own big adventure, finding new stories to call his own."
